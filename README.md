## Background
This document defines formatting and style rules for HTML, CSS. and Javascript The aim is to standardize and maintain the cooperation and the code quality. This applies to unformatted work files that use HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## General

### Indentation

Indent by 4 spaces at a time.

Donâ€™t use tabs or mix tabs and spaces for indentation.

#### HTML
```html
<ul>
    <li>That</li>
    <li>is</li>
    <li>right</li>
</ul>
```

#### CSS
```css
.example {
    color: blue;
}
```

#### Javascript
```javascript
function example() {
    return 'Hello world!';
}
```

### Trailing Whitespace
Remove trailing white spaces.

### Encoding

Use UTF-8 (no BOM).

Make sure your editor uses UTF-8 as the character encoding with no byte order mark.

Specify the coding in HTML templates and documents using `<meta charset="utf-8" />`. Do not specify the encoding of style sheets as they require UTF-8.

(For more information about encodings and when and how to specify them, see Working with Character Encodings in HTML and CSS.)

### Line endings

Format files with `\n` at the end of a line (Unix line endings). Do not use `\r\n` (Windows line endings) or `\r` (Apple operating systems).

### Comments

Explain the code as needed, if possible.

Use comments to explain the code: what does it cover, what is its purpose, why is each solution used or preferred?

## HTML Style Rules

### Write valid HTML

All HTML code must be valid and well-formed. You need to validate it against the HTML specification for the project you are working on. Use the HTML5 document type definition unless a different specification is requested or needed:

```html
<!doctype html>
```

### Document Type

Use HTML5.

(It is recommended to use HTML as text/html. Don't use XHTML. XHTML as an application/xhtml+xml does not offer any browser or infrastructure support and offers less room for optimization than HTML.)

### Lowercase names

Element and attribute names must be in lowercase:

```html
<!-- Correct -->
<input name="name" type="text">
```
```html
<!-- Wrong -->
<INPUT name="name" TYPE="text">
```

### Closing tags

Non-empty elements must have appropriate closing tags.

```html
<h1>My title</h1>
<p>Some text</p>
``` 

A corresponding closing tag must follow empty elements:

```html
<span></span>
<i></i>
```

Items with a single tag, such as `hr`, `br`, `input`, `img` must end with `>`:

```html
<br>
<hr>
<img src="example.jpg" alt="Description text" width="500" height="200">
```

### Nested elements

Nested elements must be nested accordingly - for example:

```html
<!-- Correct -->
<div>
    <p>Some text</p>
</div>
```

The `<p>` tag and the corresponding closing tag `</p>` are both nested in the `<div>` and `</div>` tags.

If elements overlap, they are not properly nested. The following code demonstrates this:

```html
<!-- Wrong -->
<div>
    <p>Some text</div>
</p>
```

### Attribute values

Attribute values, including numeric attributes, must be placed in quotation marks - for example:

```html
<!-- Correct -->
<input type="text" name="title" size="20">

<!-- Wrong -->
<input type=text name=title size=20>
```

### Special characters

Encode special characters, for example:

```html
&amp;
&quot;
&copy;
```

### HTML anchors

If you need to link to a section in an HTML document, use the ID attribute:

```html
<!-- Correct -->
<a href="#anchor">Link</a>
<div id="anchor"></div>
```

The use of named anchors is prohibited.

```html
<!-- Wrong -->
<a href="#anchor">Link</a>
<a name="anchor"></a>
```
